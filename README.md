![YOURLS shortener for Firefox](https://binfalse.de/assets/media/pics/2017/yourls-firefox/yourls.svg)

This is an extension for the Firefox browser to shorten URLs using YOURLS.

The original version is available in the [legacy](legacy/) directory. It was initially developed in 2011. However, the techniques back then are no longer supported by Firefox.

A new version of the extension is available in the [webextension](webextension/) directory.
It was rewritten in 2017.

Many thanks to @xppppp, @yfdyh000, @joshp23, @wilcochris, @tessus, and @airtonzanon for their contributions!
